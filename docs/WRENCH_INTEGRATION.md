# Wrench Integration — Canvas Completeness Checks

## Overview

Canvas integrates `wrench-inspect` to run completeness checks before planning.
The unit of inspection is the `canvas.bolt_handoff.v0.1` document
(`kind: planning_request`): `wrench check` builds the handoff from the stored
workspace and the latest `SpecPackage`, writes it to a temporary file, and runs
`wrench-inspect handoff inspect --json <file>`.

The checks are wrench-inspect's own handoff inspections:

- **Structure** — `kind` must be `planning_request`; required
  `ImplementationHandoff` fields (source, package version/hash, …) present.
- **Execution policy** — human approval for execution must be required.
- **Traceability** — every traceability reference resolves to an object
  present in the handoff context (screens, actions, sections, …).
- **Waiver separation** — waiver owner and reviewer must be distinct actors.
- **Risks / blockers / capabilities** — declared sections are well-formed.

## Usage

```bash
cargo run -p rumble-canvas -- wrench check --store target/canvas.json
```

Output (stderr carries findings, stdout the verdict):

```
Running wrench completeness checks...
summary: 0 error(s), 0 warning(s), 0 info(s)
✓ All wrench checks passed
```

On failure the command exits non-zero and each non-info finding is printed as
`SEVERITY code at path: message (recommendation)`.

## Report shape

`wrench-inspect handoff inspect --json` prints a report on stdout, then exits
`0` when `valid` and `1` otherwise (the report is printed in both cases):

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "summary": { "errors": 0, "warnings": 0, "infos": 0 },
  "findings": [],
  "coverage": { "...": "..." },
  "next_actions": []
}
```

`crates/handoff/src/wrench_integration.rs` deserializes this into
`WrenchReport` (ignoring `coverage`) and treats an invalid handoff as a
report, not a process error.

## Installation

`wrench-inspect` is installed automatically in CI via the workflow. For local
development:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/constantin-jais/wrench-inspect.git --rev 973bd76a22c84003ec4f5c3a4379f9c93fe35278
```

If `wrench-inspect` is not available, the `wrench check` command gracefully
skips checks with a warning. The integration test
(`crates/handoff/tests/wrench_integration_test.rs`) is `#[ignore]`d for the
same reason; CI installs the binary and runs it explicitly with `-- --ignored`.

## Future Extensions

- Artifact reference validation (gear-depot linkage).
- Permission matrix validation (crew-specific).
- Sector-wide checks (multi-repo).
